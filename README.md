>On this page, I used another Javascript skilll to control the video play_rate with control bar. You can control the control bar with mouse. You can fix the play_rate by simply clicking the control bar when it reaches your preferred play_rate. I also created play button on the video. It will disappear when the video starts to play and reappear again when the video is stopped.
