This is the repository for my portfolio. 

# How to start
Run ``` yarn start```, then it will listen to port:3000. 

## What I did
For this portfolio, I used Pug for Template Engine and Express for the Routing. I implemented layout.pug, 
layout.css, and layout.js to implement Cloudy_Weather background throughout the website. 

I used various Javascript skills in each page such as controlling the video play_rate by inserting the control bar and 3D 
picture album, controlling the pictures by mouse hovering, typewrite, and making the website in motion by implementing actions 
to clouds, rain (with different color), and picture.  

You can navigate through pages by hovering over the "S"letter on the top of page, where I implemented Navigation Bar. [About, JackJack, Cello, Contact, and Skills]
